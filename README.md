# ShakeSearch

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7fc94d170eff459eb06cf0ee4eb82579)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/chalu/shakesearch/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=chalu/shakesearch&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## What Is It?
[Shakesearch](https://pulley-shakesearch.onrender.com/) is a simple web app that allows a user to search for a text string in the complete works of Shakespeare.

However, the app is in a rough shape. The search is case sensitive, the results are difficult to read, and the search is limited to exact matches.

## My Mission

Improve the app!
Think about the problem from the **user's perspective** and prioritize changes according to what I think is most useful.

> I am liberty can approach the improvements with a back-end, front-end, or full-stack focus.
